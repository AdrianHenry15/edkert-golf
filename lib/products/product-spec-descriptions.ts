    javelin: `The Javelin Aer-Aid machine is a specially designed tractor mounted vertical action aerator for use on both fine and outfield turf.
            The machine can be used all year round due to the large selection of tines helping to break up compaction allowing water, 
            air and nutrients to penetrate the root zone.
            Consistent use helps to produce a surface that is less affected by the adversities of weather conditions leaving minimal disturbance.
            The Aer-Aid system injects air directly into the root zone speeding up the aeration process, 
            moving air uniformly throughout the root zone for complete aeration – not just where the tines have penetrated.
            The cam trigger mechanism ensures that the air is always expelled at the bottom of the tine penetration enabling treatment to be targeted precisely.`,

    brush_pro: `The two-in-one brushing system.
            Specially designed for synthetic surfaces, 
            the Brush-Pro is a ride on brushing system consisting of a pair of mid mounted oscillating brush units and three rear mounted brushes.
            The oscillating brushes are ideal for periodic aggressive brushing to keep infill mobile, 
            prevent algae accumulation, surface compaction and loss of porosity.
            The infill level is maintained at a constant depth giving consistent playing 
            characteristics and reducing pile damage caused by reduced infill levels. 
            The "oscillating action" is designed to be thorough and effective but gentle to avoid damage to the fibers.
            Fewer passes are required than when using conventional drag brushes causing less compaction. 
            The rear mounted brushes are designed for routine frequent use to lift the pile.`,
    svr_1500_deep_cleaner: `The two-in-one deep cleaning and decompaction machine.
            Designed for use on either sand or rubber filled surfaces, 
            the SVR 1500 is ideal for deep cleaning and aiding decompaction.
            The large diameter rotating brush lifts the contaminated infill
            and passes it through an airstream whereby the process separates initially the fine dust particles 
            and then the larger coarse debris before returning the ‘cleaned’ 
            infill back to the surface where it is brushed back into the pile. 
            The process helps to decompact surfaces, allow water to permeate through, 
            reduce bacteria, algae and moss and reduce the risk of player injury.`,
    sss1000: `Sweeping up the debris.
            Regular cleaning of synthetic surfaces is vital to avoid contamination of the surface and remove potentially harmful debris before play.
            The SSS1000 sweeper features a spiral rotary brush. Debris is swept into a mesh hopper that allows pitch infill to be returned to the surface.
            Sweeping will also pick up any loose fibres that may be common in the early weeks after installation.`,
    osca_3: `The SISIS OSCA 3 is a PTO driven gearbox, which in turn drives an oscillating bar. The number of oscillations per meter is
            controlled by the rpm of the tractor PTO and the forward speed. So the operator chooses the ideal speed to suit conditions.
            PTO must turn at 400 rpm or less.`,
    varibrush: `The SISIS VARIBRUSH has been designed for fast, effective brushing on natural or synthetic turf. The multiple brushing
                action allows the required treatment to be carried out with fewer passes, therefore reducing compaction.
                The SISIS VARIBRUSH can be used to brush top dressings into natural or synthetic turf surfaces; to lift the grasses prior to
                mowing for a better cut; dew dispersal; to give a striped effect on natural turf for improved presentation.

                brushing surface infill to an even and level finish and eye-catching presentation. 
                Easy to assemble and dismantle into three sections for ease of transportation and storage.`,
    powaspred: `Whether it is across the whole of the surface or localized areas, 
                infill levels can be reduced to a level where a top up of sand or rubber crumb is required.
                The Powaspred is a tractor mounted dresser capable of spreading either infill at the desired rate with an even consistent spread.`,
    tractor_brush_combinations: `Combination brush systems which are ideal for regular maintenance of synthetic surfaces. 
                The flexicomb and straight finishing brush combination is recommended for both sand and rubber infill.
                The flexicomb ensures even distribution of infill and lifts the pile whilst the straight brush produces a smooth level and eye catching presentation.
                For rubber crumb surfaces a more aggressive brushing is required and this can be achieved by adjusting the crossbar on the flexicomb to stiffen the bristles.
                A combination of Zig Zag and straight brush's provides a four section angled action and a finish to ensure a maximum brushing effect.`,
    tractor_rake_and_brush_combinations: `Simple in operation with impressive performance.
                Tractor mounted rake and brush combination for decompacting either sand or rubber infill surfaces. 
                Using either the fine grooming rake or 
                the flexicomb with a straight brush will loosen the infill mix ensuring true 
                and level playing characteristics, reduce the risk of injury, 
                help maintain the surface lifespan and prevent standing water.
                The adjustable crossbar on the flexicomb allows the length of the 
                bristles to be altered to meet raking and brushing needs of sand and rubber infills.`,
    towed_brush_combination: `Designed specifically for regular routine brushing, 
                the towed brush combinations can be used by almost any small ride-on power unit including compact garden tractors.
                Regular brushing should ideally take place following every 8-10 hours of play.
                The flexicomb can be used on sand infill surfaces and 
                also used more aggressively on rubber crumb infull by adjusting the crossbar and shortening the length of the bristles.
                The straight brush is ideal as a 'smooth finishing' brush and enhancing presentation.`,
